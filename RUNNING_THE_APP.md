# How to Run the App

The app is a Vite dev server — there is no single file to open directly in a browser.

## Steps

1. Open a terminal in the project folder
2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Notes

- The dev server must be running for the app to work — it is not a static file
- If you close the terminal, the server stops and the URL will no longer load
- To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- If `npm` is not found, open a fresh terminal (Node.js updates your PATH on new sessions)
